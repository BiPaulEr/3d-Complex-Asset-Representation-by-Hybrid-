The main explaination of the code is in the Mesh.h file.	 Think to use Ctrl+M+O to close each section to make it more readable.
This code should be rapidly improve by using std::vector<reserve>.reserve and .embrace instead of push_back to avoid duplication of copy construteur.
This code should be improve with a transfer from all the function provided in Mesh to analysis in a different object. 
The methods of analysis are too much link to each other.
